    "# Combinatorial Poetry: House of Dust\n",
    "\n",
    "“House of Dust” was a mid-century collaboration between Fluxus artist Alison Knowles and the composer James Tenney. Published in 1967, it is an early example of born-digital combinatorial poetry.  While the original program was authored in the now obsolete Fortran programming language, Nick Montfort [has reimplemented it](https://nickm.com/memslam/a_house_of_dust.html) in both Javascript and Python and made the code freely available for modification. Your first assignment adapts one used by Montfort in [Exploratory Programming for the Arts and Humanities](https://mitpress.ublish.com/ereader/12629?preview=#page/31). The poem has been repeatedly modified by other artists: Stephanie Strickland and Ian Hatcher, for example, have created \"House of Trust,\" referring to libraries, and [Lillian-Yvonne Bertram](https://www.lillianyvonnebertram.com/) has published \"A New Sermon on the Warpland,\"referencing Gwendolyn Brooks' \"A Sermon on the Warpland.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "“House of Dust” is a simple text generator that makes use of what [Carolyn Lamb and collaborators](https://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2016/bridges2016-195.pdf) call “templates” or “slot fillers.” Each stanza contains four lines that describe a house using a set formula and repetitive pattern: the first line describes the material of the house (e.g., “dust”, “stone”); the second, its location or setting (e.g., “among high mountains”, “on an island”); the third, its light source; and the fourth, the house’s inhabitants. Running on a loop, the program will randomly select from a list of items for each of the four categories, producing new stanzas with variable output in perpetuity. The key ingredients of the Python program can be easily enumerated:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A repetitive template or structure\n",
    "2. Data that can be used to populate the slots in the template\n",
    "3. A reliance on randomness to select items from the available data and insert them in the appropriate slots in the poem\n",
    "4. A loop structure that will continuously output new results\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-Class Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you embark on the graded assignment, we'll first experiment with modding \"House of Dust\" in class (scroll down further in the notebook to read the full instructions for the graded assignment). Practice changing “House of Dust” output by altering, substituting, deleting, or adding to list elements in the program, honoring the distinction between data and code. In general, you want to alter the data stored in lists for all four of the poem’s categories: “material”, “place”, “light source”, and “inhabitants.” For example, in the “Materials” category, you might replace “sand” with “books,” creating the permutation “house of books.” Or in the “light source” category, you might add “moonlight,” creating the potential configuration “using moonlight”. Be sure to preserve syntax and formatting so that you don’t break the python code (note, for instance, how each list item is contained in single quotation marks and followed by a comma to separate it from its neighbors. And all list items for a single variable are grouped together using square brackets).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve made those initial alterations, try introducing more extensive interventions, including at the level of code. A couple ideas:\n",
    "consider altering the speed of the display by changing the number of seconds that elapse before a new stanza is generated. (Replace the “1” after “time.elapse” to something else)\n",
    "Try adding an entirely new category/variable to the fourfold set that already exists. For example, a “Time” variable might be appended at the end of each stanza, following the already existing “material”, “place”, “light source”, and “inhabitants” variables. Can you think of other meaningful categories? Be sure to populate your new categories with appropriate text strings."

    "If you'd like to experiment with changing the font color of your \"House of Dust\" output, try installing the *fontstyle* library by running the code cell below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've installed the library, you're ready to experiment with it. In the same way you had to previously import the Random library to run the \"House of Dust\" code, you'll need to do the same thing with fontstyle. Two cells below is the new code with the imported fontstyle library, plus examples of how to use it. Study the \"print\" lines carefully to see how fontstyle has been applied. Note that you are apparently limited to color names (e.g., \"blue\"); hex color codes (e.g., \"0B4B5C\") do not seem to work. Your color palette is confined to a handful of primary and secondary colors, such as blue, green, yellow, red, and purple. Take note of where to plug in your colors, replacing my choices with yours. \n"

    "# House of Dust Mod\n",
    "### Due: 3 March 20% of Grade\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook for this assignment should contain the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. House of Dust mod (give it a new title!)\n",
    "2. One or more illustrations (review your [first Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/karikraus/introduction-to-jupyter-notebook/HEAD) to see how to add images)\n",
    "3. Artist’s Statement (800-1200 words, carefully proofread and formatted using Markdown)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment you’ll modify “House of Dust” to create a customized version of the poem. As a creative constraint, you should preserve Alison Knowles’ four original list categories (“material, “location,” “light source,” and “inhabitants”), making sure to replace the items she uses for each category with those of your own. You can, if you wish, also add one or two additional categories, populating them with appropriate items. Finally, you should select 2-3 stanza outputs to curate and briefly discuss in your artist’s statement. These should be carefully formatted in Markdown (be sure to include line breaks). \n",
    "\n",
    "In broad strokes, your artist’s statement should offer a short narrative or account of the thought processes that led you to your overarching idea, as well as a discussion of how you attempted to realize that vision or idea, capturing any setbacks or challenges you encountered along the way, either artistically or technologically. More specifically, here are some of the questions you should entertain and address:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the intended theme or style of your piece? Are the atmospherics mysterious, meditative, comic, campy, or something else entirely? Were you inspired by any particular books, films, or other media? \n",
    "2. Did you encounter any setbacks, either artistic or technological? How did you address them? \n",
    "3. What illustrations did you choose and why?\n",
    "4. What made you select the stanzas you did for curation? What intrigued you about them?\n",
    "5. Do you feel any creative ownership over your modded version? Why or why not? Who is the author (or authors) of your modded version? These questions ask you to think about the poem as you found it and the poem as you remade it, to paraphrase the literary critic Rob Pope. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should also give consideration to evaluation criteria for combinatorial poetry, per our class discussion of Scott Rettberg’s chapter 2 in Electronic Literature. After observing that print poems are static while computer-generated poems are permutational, Rettberg stakes out the following position on what makes a combinatorial poem good or bad:\n",
    "\n",
    ">While the author of a poem intended for print publication is striving for a singularity – the one perfect expression of what they are trying to communicate – the author of a poetry generator is striving for multiplicity. A combinatory poetry generator uses variables to produce a factorial number of outputs. When this is the case, not all the outputs will be equally interesting as literature. But the best systems will produce outputs that are compelling literary experiences more often than not. The goal for the author of a combinatory work is not to produce the best literary expression of an idea, but the most interesting range of possibilities the literary system can produce. (Rettberg, 43). \n",
    "\n",
    "How have you attempted to “strive for multiplicity” and “the most interesting range of possibilities” that your House of Dust mod is capable of?\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will be assessed according to the following criteria (adapted from [Professor Mark Sample](https://www.davidson.edu/people/mark-sample) at Davidson College):\n",
    "1. Craft (the degree of mastery of the mode of composition or representation)\n",
    "2. Intention (the sense of intentionality and deliberateness of the work)\n",
    "3. Theme (the level of engagement with the designated theme of the mod)\n",
    "4. Argument (the degree to which your project and artist’s statement make a claim or thoughtful argument about electronic literature, authorship, combinatorial poetry, and related topics we’ve discussed in class that are relevant to the assignment)\n",
    "5. Resiliency (the degree to which you're able to resourcefully recover from failure when something in your project goes spectacularly wrong)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fostering an Atmosphere of Trust and Respect\n",
    "Since we'll often share work, I want to include additional guidelines for fostering an atmosphere of trust and respect. When formulating your ideas and pursuing projects and experiments, please [heed the excellent advice](https://rwet.decontextualize.com/) offered by professor and e-lit author extraordinaire Allison Parrish:\n",
    "\n",
    "Read Leonard Richardson’s [\"Bots Should Punch Up\"](https://www.crummy.com/2013/11/27/0). “You can poke fun at yourself (Stephen Colbert famously said ‘There’s no status I would not surrender for a joke’), you can make a joke at the expense of someone with higher social status than you, but if you mock someone with lower status, it’s not cool.” Be sensitive to what your classmates (and others) might find offensive, triggering, or violent; be graceful (not defensive) and listen carefully when your work gets called out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: you can copy-and-paste code cells to create duplicates. You might want to create several cells with the \"House of Dust\" code so that if you make a mistake and get an error message, you can start with a fresh cell. Review the first notebook if you've forgotten how to add and delete cells.\n"
